# Typescript Type Challenges List

## intro

Typescript Type Challenges List is a collection based on [**Type Challenges**](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges).
which contains many typescript type system puzzles.
> This project is aimed at helping you better understand how the type system works, writing your own utilities, or just having fun with the challenges. We are also trying to form a community that you can ask questions and get answers you have faced in the real world - they may become part of the challenges!

## Why built this

I always forget how I solved these puzzles, but when I try to figure out how, it's hard to find by **Type Challenges** UI.

**Type Challenges** depends on github repository pages which makes hard to jump between different sites.

So I build this site collect all actions of challenge into one place, provides at least one solution and extra type information without navigate to other places.

## Features

- [x] all actions in one page
- [x] code snippets with type information
- [x] quick check the easy answer
